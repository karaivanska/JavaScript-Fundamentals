/*
Write a JS program that modifies a number until the average value of all of its digits is higher than 5. In order to modify the number, your program should append a 9 to the end of the number, when the average value of all of its digits is higher than 5 the program should stop appending. If the numberâ€™s average value of all of its digits is already higher than 5, no appending should be done.
The input is a single number.
The output should consist of a single number - the final modified number which has an average value of all of its digits higher than 5. The output should be printed on the console.
